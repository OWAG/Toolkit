# Toolkit
The Open Web Apps Group application toolkit

## About

This toolkit contains snippets, recipies, components, samples and best practices in the form of code. This can be anything at all that you deem useful that can help towards the OWAG vision. The only constraint in this repo is that all contributions here should be framework-agnostic, and not depend on layout libraries such as bootstrap.
